      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p className="about__description">
        I'm Andres, an AI Developer specializing in Generative AI and large language model (LLM) systems. I design and build end-to-end AI solutions—from research prototypes to production-ready services—leveraging FastAPI backends, React frontends, and state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks.
      </p>
      <p className="about__description">
        My work spans reverse search engines powered by neural embeddings (FindIT), node-graph agent orchestration tools (Novus Talk & magic-agents), encrypted file-sharing platforms (JustAnotherFileStorage), and unified LLM provider wrappers (magic-llm). I'm passionate about diffusion models, vector databases (Qdrant), and autonomous agent systems that bridge the gap between research and real-world applications.
